## Merkle tree traversal algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of some of the algorithms described in [1], section 4: _Authentication path computation_. These implementations were created to aid in my own understanding of the algorithms, and not for use in any kind of production context. They are in no way guaranteed to be correct or optimised for anything other than readability.
